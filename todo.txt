TODOs:

Namespaces for nearly everything:
	Variables
	Functions

	There should be a cost in doing everything on his own, as there
	should exist considerable pressure to merge models and data with
	others.

Function libraries

Data should be possible to strip to time records for later analysis.
	Could be done with database triggers, which populate data changes
	with timestamp to result dataset of a simulation.
